    In the last few decades, the importance of internships for a career development has grown. However, the difficulty to search through possible
internships has not decreased. Undergraduate students are forced to spend long hours and use multiple job searching
websites for internships. Furthermore, these websites do not provide them with internships that they fully qualify for. Thus, the
Internaloha project provides an alternative ”shortcut” for students seeking internships. The approach of Internaloha is creating
a scraper to extract Computer Science internships from the different job websites and have them integrated into RadGrad’s
internship explorer page. The goal for Internaloha Version 2 is to recreate them using TypeScript and clean it up to look
more efficient.
