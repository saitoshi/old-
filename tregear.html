<hr>
<p> A Japanese to English translation done for JPN 425 Project. The original story was written by NAKANO Takao and
  talks about how the character Tregear became a villian. </p>
  <hr>
The name “Tregear” in the seven spaces means “disaster”, “temptation”, and “contraindication“. This is the story when “he” was still an Ultraman at the Land of Light….

The translation process was done in the following:
<ul>
  <li> Literal Translation <br/>
    A literal translation from Japanese to English without thinking whether it would make
    sense for English speaking audience.
  <li> Modified Translation <br/>
    A translation to see what phrases should be fixed in order to make it sound smooth and makes sense
    for English readers.
  <li> Final Draft <br/>
    A last check of grammar and mistranslations to see whether the context of the original source is not lost in
    the translations.
