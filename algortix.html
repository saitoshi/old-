<b><u>Overview</u></b> <br/>
During the 6 week period of ICS 427, the class was broken into teams of 3-4 people of their choice and were
asked to work on a single application project that highlighted the elements of Software Quality Assurance.
         <br/>
The group I was part of was called <a href="https://cross-country-coders.github.io/">Cross Country Coders</a>.
The application that the group created was called Algo-Trix which is a user-based application that people can study algorithms.

<b><u>Contributions to AlgoTrix</u></b><br/>
    With ICS 427 being a six week course, our group took advantage of GitHub's <i>Kanban</i> by making Weekly Milestone Issues where each
    week a member selected an issue to work on.
    <ol>
             <li><a href="https://github.com/cross-country-coders/algo-trix/projects/1">Milestone 1</a></li>
             For Milestone 1, the main goal was to get the mock designs for the application to be created.
             To begin with the group used <a href={"https://www.figma.com/files/recent?fuid=934216239644834346"}>Figma</a> to make mock up designs. I did the Landing Page, Sample Problem, and Notes Pages.
