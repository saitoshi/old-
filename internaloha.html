For my Capstone Project course (<a href ="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/catalog/courses/ics-496-capstone-project-3/">ICS 469</a>) I have teamed up with Professor Johnson with the development of Internaloha Scrappers.
<ul>
  <li>Group Organization: <a href = "https://internaloha.github.io/documentation/">LINK</a></li>
  <li>GitHub Repository: <a href ="https://github.com/internaloha/scrapers">LINK</a></li>
  </ul>
  <b><u>Purpose</u></b><br/>
  The main purpose of this project was to update the previous scrappers by using TypeScript and a common format. Previously, the scrappers were written by a different group of students where the basic format was not necessarily uniform.
  For the Fall 2021, our main goal was to update is using classes and making it more unified within the different scrappers. <br/>
  Using the <a href ="https://github.com/internaloha/scrapers/projects/1">Project Board</a> function from GitHub, each student worked on a certain issue regarding to the scrappers.
  <br/>
  Below are the different scrappers and a brief summary associated to it. <br/>
  <b>ZipRecruiter Scrapper</b><br/>
  This was the first scrapper I have worked on with the new format. Initially, I based it off of the previous ZipRecruiter scrapper.
  However, I noticed that there were issues with following it. Thus, decided to trust my own confidence and was able to create the ZipRecruiter scrapper.

  This was the fourth scrapper I have worked on. <br/>
  Initially, the pattern was similar to others so writing it initially was not bad. However, after doing a test scrape I noticed that the total jobs scrapped were greater than the amount of internships available.
  I noticed that the scrapper scraped the recommended jobs. Therefore, to avoid this I extracted the number of internships listed on the page and then did the for loop based on that instead of the urls.length.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <code>
    <p>
      // extract the number of internships currently available<br/>
      const key = await super.getValue('span[class="description fc-light fs-body1"]', 'innerText');
      <br/>
      const jobNumber = key.match(/\d+/gm);
      <br/>
      this.log.debug(`Amount of internships available: \n${jobNumber[0]}`);
      <br/>
      for (let i = 0; i < jobNumber ; i++) </p>
  </code>
